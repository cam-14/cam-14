Followed the Lab notes to create the basics for this blog platform.
Took some time to get the GitHub pages to work properly.

Lecturer Notes:
Created a simple website using GitHub Pages with integrated Jekyll (note md files use Markdown for syntax
formatting). **Bold** words. As Markdown is actually is a lot easier to use for writing posts/notes than raw
HTML.
