### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

this is a blog posting website. except you can't post, i do it manually with the assistance of Jekyll :) have fun

this website has 4 sections:
  -home
  -blog
  -about
  -about2
  
 Home doesn't do a lot, it just lists some of the things used and you can navigate around the website
 
 Blog lists and links the blog posts
 
 About just demonstrates my abililty to use html and css
 
 About 2 shows that i can create a new page with the Jekyll layout function
