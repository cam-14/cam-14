  <body style="background-color:black;color:white;">
    the body uses inline styling
    <p class="myclass">
    this is a basic blog posting template using github and jekyll
    this paragraph uses the class "myclass"
    classes can be used for multiple elements on a document
  
    </p>
    <div id="myid">
      this div uses the id "myid"
      <h3 id="myid">
        <header 3>
        you can also use an id on multiple elements on a document but it defeats the purpose as it is no longer a unique identifier<br>
        e.g. if you were to use JS and wanted to extract an element from the document by the ID then it would not work
